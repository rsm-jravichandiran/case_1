    "In this case, we'll apply what you've learned about programming so far and start using **functions**. Functions are building blocks you can use and re-use in your code. At this stage in your programming journey we encourage you to use mostly loops and if-else statements for your calculations. This will force you to build up your code in chunks that will ultimately connect together to produce the desired result. It will also give you a better mental model of what Python is doing \"under the hood\" when using functions and methods from tools like `pandas` and `numpy` to solve complex problems."
